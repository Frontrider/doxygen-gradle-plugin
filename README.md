# Various Incubating Gradle Plugins

This project was born out of of having to do various things in Gradle for which support was not
yet available. Typically this would have been where usage of Gradle was not mainstream or new
technology that came along was not yet available in Gradle.

## Emancipated Plugins

- [Bintray Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/ysb33r/bintray)
- [GNUMake Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/ysb33r/gnumake-gradle-plugin)

## Incubating Plugins
